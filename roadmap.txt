# Roadmap: Controlling Rope Dynamics with a Robot Arm

## Phase 1: Define Project Scope and Setup

### 1. High-Level Requirements Gathering
- Define key objectives:
  - Simulate rope dynamics.
  - Control the robot arm and rope dynamics.
  - Compare DMDc and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches.
- Establish performance indicators (e.g., accuracy, robustness, smoothness, efficiency).

### 2. Tools and Software Setup
- Select **PyBullet** as the simulation environment.
- Install required packages: PyBullet, NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch, SciPy, Matplotlib.
- Test environment setup: Load a Franka Panda robot arm model in PyBullet.

### 3. Simulation Environment Preparation
- Develop base environment class (`RopeSimulationEnv`):
  - Load robot arm and rope models.
  - Define a step function for control and simulation.
- **Test 1**: Verify proper loading and movement of the arm and realistic rope behavior.

## Phase 2: Basic Dynamics of Rope and Robot

### 1. Rope Modeling and Dynamics
- Represent rope as connected rigid bodies (chain of joints).
- Adjust properties like mass, damping, and stiffness for realistic dynamics.
- **Test 2**: Move the arm with simple trajectories, adjusting parameters until rope behaves realistically.

### 2. Basic Robot Arm Control
- Implement inverse kinematics (IK) for end-effector control.
- Develop an interface for specifying end-effector positions.
- **Test 3**: Test various movements of the end-effector and observe rope movement.

## Phase 3: Develop Control Strategies (DMDc & RL)

### 1. Collect Data for DMDc
- Use simple movements to collect data for rope dynamics (positions and velocities).
- Store states and actions for DMDc training.
- **Test 4**: Verify the data collection process by visualizing trajectories.

### 2. DMDc Implementation
- Implement **Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc)**.
- Use collected data to build a control model and implement an LQR controller.
- **Test 5**: Test the DMDc-based controller to ensure it controls the rope's loose end accurately.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning Setup
- Create RL environment with OpenAI Gym-style interface.
  - Define states, actions, and rewards.
- **Test 6**: Train an RL agent for simple tasks and verify early performance.

## Phase 4: Incremental Improvement & Testing

### 1. Progressively Complexify Control Tasks
- Start with simple control tasks (e.g., bring loose end to target point).
- Increase task complexity (e.g., follow a trajectory with multiple target points).
- **Test 7**: Visualize each task's performance for both DMDc and RL controllers.

### 2. Compare Control Strategies
- Compare **DMDc** and **RL** approaches based on accuracy, stability, efficiency, and robustness.
- **Test 8**: Run comparisons and record key metrics for both strategies.

## Phase 5: Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize DMDc and RL hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, modes).
- Use cross-validation for parameter optimization.
- **Test 9**: Re-run experiments with optimized parameters and compare improvements.

### 2. Edge Cases and Robustness Testing
- Test for edge cases: abrupt movements, high-speed oscillations, disturbances.
- Improve robustness to generalize to diverse scenarios.
- **Test 10**: Perform stress tests and evaluate controllersâ€™ robustness.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Visualization

### 1. Visualization Tools
- Develop visualization tools for movement trajectories and performance metrics.
- Create a dashboard or GUI for real-time simulation interaction.

### 2. Documentation
- Document each module, setup instructions, and key functions.
- Include notes on best practices for tuning and expected behavior.

### 3. Final Comparison and Report
- Summarize findings from **DMDc** and **RL** comparison.
- Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and potential use cases.
- **Test 11**: Prepare a comprehensive report including plots and analyses.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Physics Fidelity**: Consider PyBullet limitations, and potentially use Mujoco or SOFA for more precise physics.
- **Debugging Tools**: Use tools like Matplotlib to visualize trajectories.
- **Computation Resources**: Reinforcement learning may require cloud or GPU resources.

## Incremental Testing Summary
- Testing at every stage is crucial to catch errors early.
- Visual inspection of robot and rope movement ensures physical plausibility.
